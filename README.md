# Diagnosing Crohn's Disease using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with an MLP classifier

Using deep learning techniques to improve on baseline classification accuracy for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

Applied dimensionality reduction followed by baseline classifiers and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.

Evaluated model performance with bootstrap validation due to small sample size, ran permutation tests to validate signficance of model classification performance.
